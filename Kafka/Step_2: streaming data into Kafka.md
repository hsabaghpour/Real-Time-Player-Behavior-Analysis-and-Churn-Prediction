Step 2: Data Streaming into Kafka

We will create a Python script that acts as a producer to send simulated player behavior data to Kafka in real-time. Here’s how we can approach this:

Sub-steps for Step 2:

	1.	Prepare the Python environment:
	•	Install necessary dependencies such as kafka-python for Python integration with Kafka.
	2.	Generate player behavior data:
	•	Create or simulate player data such as login time, session duration, game played, win/loss status, etc.
	3.	Write a producer script:
	•	Write a Python script that will continuously send player data to the test_topic topic in Kafka.
	4.	Test the streaming:
	•	Send data from the producer to Kafka and verify if the messages are being consumed successfully by the consumer.

Let’s dive into the first sub-step:



Sub-Step 1: Prepare the Python environment

	1.	Install Python dependencies: First, we need to install kafka-python, a Python library that allows us to interact with Kafka.

Run the following command to install the required library:

pip install kafka-python

Player Behavior Data Example:

	•	player_id: Unique identifier for the player.
	•	login_time: The timestamp when the player logs in.
	•	session_duration: The length of the session in seconds.
	•	game_played: The name of the game played.
	•	win_loss: Whether the player won or lost the game (binary: 1 for win, 0 for loss).
	•	amount_bet: The amount the player bet in the game.

Now, let’s simulate this data using Python.

Explanation:

	•	generate_player_data(): Generates random player behavior data.
	•	Kafka Producer: The producer connects to Kafka running on localhost:9092 and sends data to test_topic.
	•	Data Sending Loop: The script continuously sends player data every 2 seconds.
